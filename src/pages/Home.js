      <h1>Supto ❤️ Shiropa</h1>
      <p>
        In 2023, Supto first fell in love with Shiropa at first sight. He prayed
        to God to make her his. After Durga Puja on 20 October 2024, their
        relationship officially started. Since then, their love grows day by
        day — simple, true and beautiful.
